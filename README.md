# DotNet Watcher
This is a open source tool for monitoring the activities happening in an .Net application using MDbgEngine. Moved from [CodePlex](https://archive.codeplex.com/?p=dotnetwatcher) 

# Why this project?
This project mainly targeting the developers who are coding in .Net for years but don't know how the .Net application executes internally such as when a class is being loaded to an application etc...
There are lot more tools available in the internet with similar features.But I didn't feel those as right fit for me and hence started this.

# Implemented Features
- Capture eaten exceptions

# Planned features
- Show more details about eaten exception
- Capture when a class is loading

# You may not like
- The UI - Sorry I am not a good UI guy.
- The less details of exception - This is in before CTP stage. I had to do lot before somebody else can use :-(

You can find the MDbgCore.dll at <InstallDrive>:\Program Files\Microsoft SDKs\Windows\v7.0A\bin\NETFX 4.0 Tools\MdbgCore.dll
